# Discord-Proxy
Node / Express Proxy to simplify communication with discord.

## WHY?
- To change Voice Settings you need RPC: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rpc
    - NOT!!!: https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to, Rich-presence, also often called RPC...
- No Java Lib for "real RPC"
- apperantly game-sdk "should" support this with VoiceManager (at least until May 2023 ...)
    - still no (working) library for java...
