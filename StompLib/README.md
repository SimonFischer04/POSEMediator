# StompLib
This just packages spring-websocket and dependencies into jar to then:
1) manually! remove "jakarta" from the build jar (could not get it to exclude in pom because of deeply nesting, weird mvn dependency:treem, ...)
2) be able to use it in a JSF / Jakarta EE Application deployed on wildfly

## License info
This project itself does not do anything by itself, so do whatever you want with it, but respect the original Spring LICENSE!!!
